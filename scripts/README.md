# MTG Data Scraping Scripts

This directory contains scripts to scrape comprehensive Magic: The Gathering data from reliable sources and generate JSON files for use in the frontend application.

## Overview

The scrapers collect data from:
- **MTG Wiki (mtg.fandom.com)** - For colors, card types, and detailed mechanic descriptions
- **Scryfall API** - For comprehensive mechanics lists and fresh data

## Usage

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Individual Scrapers
```bash
# Scrape game overview only
npm run scrape:overview

# Scrape colors only
npm run scrape:colors

## Rate Limiting

The scrapers include built-in rate limiting to be respectful to the MTG Wiki:
- 500ms delay between priority mechanic requests
- 1-2 second delays between major scraper runs
- Graceful fallbacks if scraping fails

## Integration with Frontend

After running the scrapers, the data is automatically copied to `frontend/data/` where it can be imported:

```javascript
// Import the data
import gameOverview from "../data/gameOverview.json";
import colors from "../data/colors.json";
import cardTypes from "../data/cardTypes.json";
import turnPhases from "../data/turnPhases.json";
import cardAnatomy from "../data/cardAnatomy.json";
import winConditions from "../data/winConditions.json";
import deckBuilding from "../data/deckBuilding.json";
import combatBasics from "../data/combatBasics.json";
import { mechanicsDetails, getMechanicDetails } from "../data/mechanics.js";

// Use in components
const introduction = gameOverview.introduction;
const whiteColor = colors.white;
const creatureType = cardTypes.creature;
const beginningPhase = turnPhases.phases.beginning;
const manaCostInfo = cardAnatomy.cardParts.manaCost;
const lifeTotalWin = winConditions.primaryWinConditions.lifeTotal;
const deckRules = deckBuilding.fundamentalRules;
const combatSteps = combatBasics.combatSteps;
const flyingMechanic = getMechanicDetails("Flying");
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Network errors**: The scrapers include retry logic, but if wiki pages are down, fallback data is used
2. **Rate limiting**: If you get 429 errors, increase delays in the scraper files
3. **Missing data**: Some mechanics may not have detailed descriptions - this is expected for advanced mechanics

### Debugging

Run individual scrapers to isolate issues:
```bash
# Test specific scraper
npm run scrape:overview
npm run scrape:colors
npm run scrape:turn-phases
npm run scrape:win-conditions

# Check output
cat data/gameOverview.json | jq
cat data/turnPhases.json | jq
cat data/colors.json | jq
```

## Contributing

When adding new scrapers:
1. Follow the existing pattern in `scrapers/`
2. Include fallback data for reliability
3. Add rate limiting for external requests
4. Update the main index file to include your scraper
5. Add appropriate npm scripts
