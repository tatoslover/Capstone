# Documentation Accuracy Update Summary

## Branch: documentation-accuracy-update

### Overview
This branch contains updates to ensure the project documentation accurately reflects what was actually implemented, specifically correcting claims about structured learning systems.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Corrected Project Description
- **Changed from**: "structured learning platform" / "structured learning paths"
- **Changed to**: "comprehensive reference platform" / "organised reference content"
- **Rationale**: The application presents all content simultaneously without progression or prerequisites

#### 2. Updated User Stories
- **Original**: "As a new player, I want to learn MTG fundamentals through structured guides"
- **Updated**: "As a new player, I want to access MTG fundamentals through organised reference content"
- **Reflects**: Actual implementation as a reference tool, not a guided learning system

#### 3. Moved to Out of Scope
Added the following items that were claimed but not implemented:
- Structured learning paths with progression
- Curriculum-based lesson sequences
- Prerequisite systems for content
- Learning progress tracking

#### 4. Specific File Updates

##### capstone_project_document.md
- Rewritten introduction to describe it as a "reference platform"
- Updated all instances of "structured learning" to "organised reference"
- Added learning path features to "Out of Scope" section
- Clarified user flow shows "View All Topics Simultaneously"

- Line 154: Changed "systematic learning" to "quick reference"
- Line 161-162: Updated desired state description
- Line 191: Changed "structured learning approaches" to "organised reference systems"
- Line 207: Changed "structured teaching resources" to "organised reference materials"
- Line 210: Removed "progressive difficulty" expectation
- Line 255-256: Updated user story description
- Line 338-341: Added learning features to out of scope
- Line 637-638: Changed "learning platform" to "reference platform"
- Line 1426-1427: Updated overview description

##### README.md
- Line 15: Changed "Interactive Learning Path" to "Comprehensive Reference"
- Removed claim about tracking progress

### What Was Actually Built
The application is accurately described as:
- **Comprehensive Reference Guide**: All MTG topics organised in one place
- **Information Hub**: Quick access to game rules and mechanics
- **Interactive Tools**: Card search and favourites management
- **Mobile-Friendly Reference**: Accessible during gameplay

### What Was NOT Built
- No learning progression or sequences
- No prerequisite system
- No progress tracking (User Story #5 marked as not implemented)
- No "next/previous lesson" navigation
- All content accessible immediately without structure

### Academic Integrity
These changes ensure the capstone documentation accurately represents the work completed, avoiding any misrepresentation of features or functionality that could impact academic assessment.
