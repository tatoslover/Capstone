  "fundamentalRules": {
    "minimumDeckSize": {
      "title": "Minimum Deck Size",
      "rule": "60 cards minimum for Constructed formats",
      "explanation": "Most competitive formats require at least 60 cards in your main deck. While you can have more, most players stick to exactly 60 for consistency.",
      "reasoning": "Smaller decks are more consistent because you're more likely to draw the cards you need when you need them.",
      "formatVariations": {
        "Standard/Modern/Pioneer": "60 cards minimum",
        "Commander": "Exactly 100 cards",

    },
    "cardLimits": {
      "title": "Card Copy Limits",
      "rule": "Maximum 4 copies of any card (except basic lands)",
      "explanation": "You can include up to 4 copies of any non-basic land card in your deck. Basic lands (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest) have no limit.",
      "reasoning": "This rule prevents decks from being too consistent or powerful by limiting access to the best cards.",
      "exceptions": [
        "Basic lands have no limit",
        "Some formats have different restrictions",
        "Cards like Relentless Rats have special text overriding this rule"

    },
    "sideboards": {
      "title": "Sideboard Rules",
      "rule": "Exactly 15 cards in competitive play",
      "explanation": "The sideboard contains cards you can swap in between games in a match to adapt to your opponent's strategy.",
      "usage": "After game 1, you can replace any number of cards from your main deck with cards from your sideboard, maintaining the same total deck size.",
      "tips": [
        "Include answers to popular strategies",
        "Add cards for bad matchups",
        "Consider additional win conditions",

      "title": "Mana Base Construction",
      "landCount": "Typically 24-26 lands in a 60-card deck",
