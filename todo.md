# TODO - Final Phase Implementation Plan

## High Priority (Critical Final Features)

### 1. Header Health Dashboard Integration - üè• NEW
**Issue:** Health dashboard currently only accessible via floating button (Ctrl+Shift+P) or documentation page
**Goal:** Integrate performance health indicator into navigation header for always-visible system status
**Solution Required:**
- Add compact `PerformanceHealthIndicator` to `Layout.js` header near connection status
- Create header-optimised display mode (smaller, icon-focused)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness doesn't break navigation
- Link to full dashboard for detailed metrics

**Status:** Components exist and functional - need integration and styling

### 2. Release History Implementation - üìà ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Issue:** Release strategy documented but not implemented
**Goal:** Create GitHub releases and display release history in application
**Solution Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Executed release strategy: created Git tags for v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.3.0 with descriptions from `release_strategy.md`
- ‚úÖ Added ReleaseHistory component to documentation page with GitHub API integration
- ‚úÖ Implemented fallback system for offline release data display
- ‚úÖ Updated README.md with comprehensive release information table
- ‚úÖ Added release notes section to main documentation

**Status:** Fully implemented with GitHub API integration and professional presentation

### 3. Figma Prototype Creation - üé® NEW
**Issue:** No design documentation for assessment showcase
**Goal:** Professional design prototype demonstrating UI/UX design thinking
**Solution Required:**
- Create Figma workspace with key user flows: onboarding ‚Üí search ‚Üí favourites ‚Üí documentation
- Document design system: colour schemes, typography hierarchy, spacing, component library
- Show mobile and desktop responsive layouts
- Include accessibility considerations and design rationale

**Status:** New requirement - full creation needed

## Medium Priority (Content Polish)

### 4. Performance Dashboard Accessibility - ‚ö° ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue:** User reports dashboard button not working - likely production mode limitation
**Root Cause:** PerformanceWrapper only shows toggle button in development mode or with localStorage flag
**Solution Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Modified PerformanceWrapper to always enable dashboard in production
- ‚úÖ Floating üìä button now permanently available on live app
- ‚úÖ Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` always accessible
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation to reflect production availability
- ‚úÖ Added professional monitoring capabilities for assessment

**Status:** Fully implemented - dashboard now permanently accessible in production with professional monitoring

### 5. Content Management Cleanup - üìù PARTIALLY COMPLETE
**Remaining Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Delete Canadian Highlander content (verify removal)
- ‚úÖ Convert future steps to proper bullet points format
- Add Setup password authentication to roadmap
- Add Market app concept to product expansion documentation
- Review mechanics guide for optimal card integration display
- Implement retractable buttons for game modes section

## Low Priority (Documentation Enhancement)

### 6. Documentation Improvements - üìö MINOR UPDATES
**Status:** Comprehensive documentation exists - minor enhancements needed
**Remaining Actions:**
- Add Figma prototype link to planning section
- Reference release history in main README
- Ensure all wiki scraping references are accurate
- Document health dashboard access methods

### 7. Header/TOC Organisation - üóÇÔ∏è STRUCTURAL
**Actions:**
- Integrate health indicator without disrupting mobile navigation
- Review table of contents structure with new health dashboard
- Optimise header hierarchy for better UX flow
- Ensure unique emoji usage throughout navigation

### 8. UI/UX Final Polish - ‚ú® REFINEMENTS  
**Actions:**
- Ensure colourless mana coverage is complete throughout application
- Review all UI components for UK English consistency
- Verify all globals.css styling is optimised
- Test health dashboard integration across all screen sizes

## Notes
- All changes must maintain UK spelling (favourites, colour, organisation, etc.)
- Use globals.css for all styling modifications
- Avoid regex searches to conserve development tokens
- Reference existing `release_strategy.md` for GitHub release creation
- Health dashboard components are fully functional - integration focus needed

## Assessment Showcase Priorities
1. **Performance Story**: Health dashboard demonstrates production-ready monitoring
2. **Release Timeline**: GitHub releases show professional development lifecycle  
3. **Design Documentation**: Figma prototype evidences UI/UX design thinking
4. **Security Excellence**: Highlight 100/100 security audit score
5. **Testing Coverage**: Emphasise 96 passing tests as quality assurance
6. **Professional Practices**: Release strategy + health monitoring = production mindset

## Implementation Order
**Phase 1 (Quick Wins):** ‚úÖ Header health integration + ‚úÖ Release history creation + ‚úÖ Production dashboard access
**Phase 2 (Design):** Figma prototype development
**Phase 3 (Polish):** Content cleanup and final refinements

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days remaining for Figma and final polish
**Current Status:** 98% feature complete - Figma prototype and header integration remaining
