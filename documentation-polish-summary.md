# Documentation Polish Summary

## Branch: documentation-polish

### Overview
This branch contains updates to the project documentation to accurately reflect the current implementation state, particularly regarding deployment processes and CI/CD status.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. CI/CD References Updated
- **Removed false claims** about automated CI/CD implementation
- **Moved CI/CD to "Out of Scope"** section with related items:
  - CI/CD pipeline implementation
  - Automated testing workflows
  - GitHub Actions integration
  - Continuous deployment processes
- **Updated deployment descriptions** to reflect manual process

#### 2. Specific File Changes

##### frontend/pages/documentation.js
- Line 236: Changed "with automated CI/CD" to "with manual deployment process"
- Line 332-337: Added CI/CD items to "Out of Scope" section
- Line 442: Changed "CI/CD pipeline configuration" to "Development environment configuration"
- Line 495-496: Updated deployment risks to remove CI/CD reference
- Line 589-590: Clarified Vercel deployment as manual process
- Line 594-610: Added new "Manual Deployment Process" section
- Replaced excessive use of "comprehensive" with varied vocabulary (robust, thorough, extensive, complete, detailed)

##### frontend/components/ReleaseHistory.js
- Line 80: Updated to "Manual deployment process established for better control"

##### README.md
- Line 74: Changed deployment description to "Railway with manual deployment process"
- Line 230: Updated DevOps practices to remove CI/CD automation reference

##### TESTING.md
- Line 362: Added "(Future Enhancement)" to Continuous Integration section
- Line 365: Added note that CI/CD is not currently implemented
- Line 390-393: Added "Current Testing Process" section explaining manual test execution

#### 3. UK Spelling Compliance
- Changed "Market app as a product" to "Commercialise app as a product"
- Verified correct usage of: favourites, colour, organisation, optimised, centralised

#### 4. Content Improvements
- Added explicit documentation of manual deployment process
- Clarified that while deployment platforms support CI/CD, the project uses manual deployment
- Reduced redundancy in language use
- Improved accuracy of technical claims

### Rationale
These changes ensure the documentation accurately reflects the project's current state. The manual deployment process is now explicitly documented, and CI/CD is properly positioned as a future enhancement rather than an implemented feature. This transparency helps set correct expectations for users and contributors.

### Next Steps
1. Review all changes in this branch
2. Test that documentation renders correctly
3. Merge to main branch when approved
